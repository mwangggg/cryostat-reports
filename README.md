# cryostat-reports

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## API

This microservice exposes only one API endpoint: `POST /report`. This expects `multipart/form-data`,
with a form field named `file` containing a JFR binary file (`application/octet-stream`). The response
is an Automated Analysis Report in `text/html` format. The uploaded file is not preserved and no
caching is performed - this is expected to be handled by the "parent" Cryostat application that is
sending the JFR binary data.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

An OCI image tagged as `quay.io/cryostatio/cryostat-reports` will also be built using `podman`
and loaded into your local `podman` image registry.

If a Quarkus build failure is encountered due to being unable to build a Docker image, then:
```shell script
sudo dnf install podman-docker
```

**Note**: If `docker` is already installed, then starting the `docker` service will solve the issue.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/cryostat-reports-*-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.

Native image mode requires registration of reflective classes and accesses. See this guide for detail:
https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Agent/

In short, download the GraalVM CE distribution. Then do:
```bash
# replace with actual path to downloaded and extracted GraalVM
export JAVA_HOME=~/workspace/graalvm-ce-java17-21.3/
# run the application JAR with the tracing agent attached. This is a JVM-mode JAR!
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=graal-config -jar target/cryostat-reports-*-runner.jar
# in another terminal, make a request to exercise the expected microservice code path. Some "fully-featured"
# JFR file should be used here - one that uses all possible event types used in rules analysis,
# so that all rule pathways execute
http -f :8080/report file@example.jfr
# ctrl-c to kill the running Quarkus application, then
# cp graal-config/* src/main/resources/
```
